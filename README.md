Build from Git
--------------

To build j4status-plugins from Git, you will need some additional dependencies:
- autoconf 2.65 (or newer)
- automake 1.11 (or newer)
- libtool
- pkg-config 0.25 (or newer) or pkgconf 0.2 (or newer)

You also need to make sure Autotools and pkg-config will find the j4status files.
Therefore, before running `./autogen.sh`, you will probably need to export these two variables:
```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig'
```
